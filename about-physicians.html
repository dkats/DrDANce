<p><strong>Who am I: </strong>My name is Dan Kats, and I'm a medical student at <span class="tooltip">Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH<span class="tooltiptext">Disclaimer: This website is unaffiliated with CWRU, and everything is my own evidence-based opinion.</span></span> (Class of 2020). I've never had any issues with weight, but I was completely sedentary during middle school, high school, and college, with my amount of exercise getting increasingly worse with increasing education. I always made the excuse that I didn't have enough time, but this changed when I got into med school. During our public health block, all of the students participated in a 10,000 step challenge, in which our small groups competed against each other. To get an advantage, my small group decided to go to cycling/spinning classes together, and I've been obsessed with exercise ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Target audience and goal: </strong>Children and parents, who cannot exercise mainly due to lack of time and access to exercise facilities. This website is meant to enable exercise <em>wherever</em> and <em>whenever</em> in fun and engaging ways. From my personal experience, it was very difficult to force myself to go exercise, but using friends to hold me accountable was shockingly effective. The idea here is that parents will use their child's health as motivation for themselves, while children will look forward to doing a fun, active, playful activity with their parents. As children age, they will probably care less about their parents' opinions, but will become competitive and/or use their good exercise habits to continue being active. A bonus benefit of this will be an increase in screen-less parent-child interactions, hopefully leading to healthier relationships, especially in busy households.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery to audience: </strong>I hope that pediatricians will use this as a tool to encourage exercise in their patients. There have been studies that explored exercise prescriptions and pediatricians' reactions to them, which gave me hope that there is a need for a product like this (Grandes, G. <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Leijon, M.E. <em>et al.</em>, 2009; James, A.K. <em>et al.</em>, 2016). This website is meant to be self-explanatory, so minimal time would need to be spent on this during the already time-strapped visit. I also intend to make everything printer-friendly, so handouts can be given to patients who do not have access to the Internet at home.</p>

<p><strong>Where did the idea come from? </strong>The first month of CWRU's curriculum is devoted to public health, so the obesity epidemic of the U.S. has been on my mind ever since. There are a few studies that show that some of the biggest barriers to exercise are time, desire, and lack of interest<!-- TODO citations -->. I also have personal motivation for this project from working with a student who struggled with his weight. There a variety of complex issues in his situation, but among the causes are lack of time and lack of access to exercise facilities/classes/equipment.</p>

<p><strong>The catch: </strong>Whenever someone offers me something that's totally free (like this is), I always wonder what the catch is. I want to do my part to fight obesity and slow its progression. At the rate obesity is growing, ALL of my patients will be obese by the time I retire. I hope that it's not too late to do something about this, so I'm trying to do as much as possible while I still have "free" time (I began this during the summer between my first and second years of medical school. So, to sum up, I'm just trying to save my future self from having a 100% obese panel of patients. (I also love excuses to do some website design/computer coding.)</p>

<p><strong>Evidence: </strong>I cited/linked as many <a href="references.html">references</a> as possible, but please feel free to <a href="mailto:djk175@case.edu?subject=Dr. DANce Resource Citation">reach out</a> if there's something that I didn't explain or cite properly.</p>
