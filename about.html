<p><strong>Who am I: </strong>My name is Dan Kats, and I'm a medical student. During middle school, high school, and college, I didn't exercise at all, because I always made the excuse that I "didn't have time". However, when I got into med school, I decided that I couldn't tell my patients to exercise if I didn't do it myself. My classmates and I started going to cycling classes, and I quickly became obsessed with being active.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this for? </strong>Children and parents, who want to become more active, but do not have time or ways to workout. This website is meant to help you exercise <em>wherever</em> and <em>whenever</em> in fun and engaging ways. Exercise is incredibly important for kids' health, so a great way for parents to help their kids grow is to teach them to be active. By exercising together, parents/guardians and their kids will not only be more health, but will also have more bonding time (without bright screens between them)!</p>

<p><strong> How should this be used? </strong>On this website, you'll find lots of ideas for how to exercise at home, or wherever you are. Everything is completely free and available for download.</p>

<p><strong>Where did the idea come from? </strong>Being overweight leads to a much higher chance of disease. Exercise is a great and easy way to lose weight, boost your health, and keep yourself as healthy as possible. From my own experiences, I know that it's difficult to find the time, motivation, and equipment necessary to exercise, so I wanted to put this website together as a resource for working out at home for any amount of time.</p>
