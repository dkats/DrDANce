<h2 id="short children">Children</h2>

<p><em>At least</em> 60&nbsp;minutes or more of physical activity <em>every day</em>. There should be a pretty even mix of moderately intense aerobic, intense aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening exercise.

<h2 id="short adults">Adults (younger than 65&nbsp;years old and not recently pregnant)</h2>

<p><strong>Some physical activity is better than none, and the more, the better!</strong> Inactive adults should slowly build up their physical activity. When doing aerobic activity, do at least 10&nbsp;minutes at a time to allow your heart to speed up for an extended chunk of time. Aim for <em>at least</em> 30 minutes of exercise five days per week.</p>

<h2 id="short pregnant">Pregnant (or recently post-partum) women</h2>

<p>During pregnancy, the body goes through many changes (or is recovering from them) and it is necessary to make exercise recommendations on a case-by-case basis. Please speak to your physician about an exercise plan personalized for your body. Your doctor will love to talk about this, and can use this website for exercise ideas.</p>

<h2 id="short old">Adults over 65&nbsp;years old</h2>

<p>Older bodies have long-term wear down of bones and joints, and it is not safe to exercise as much as before. Please speak to your physician about an exercise plan personalized for your body. Your doctor will love to talk about this, and can use this website for exercise ideas.</p>

<h2 id="long children">Children</h2>

<p>Children should have <em>at least</em> 60&nbsp;minutes or more of physical activity <em>every day</em>. Any type of activity&mdash;such as recess&mdash;counts towards the 60 minutes of play; it does not have to be structured exercise time. Ideally, try to break up exercise into large, continuous times (if 60&nbsp;minutes straight can't be done, try two 30-minute blocks or four 15-minute blocks).
<ul>
	<li>Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity and aerobic</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Walking</li>
		<li>Running</li>
		<li>Skipping</li>
		<li>Playing on the playground</li>
		<li>Basketball</li>
		<li>Biking</li>
	</ul>
	<li>More intense aerobic activity &mdash; at least three days per week</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Running</li>
		<li>Jumping jacks</li>
		<li>Fast swimming</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Muscle-strengthening activities &mdash; at least three days per week</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Playing on playground equipment</li>
		<li>Tug-of-war</li>
		<li>Pushups</li>
		<li>Pullups</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Bone-strengthening activities &mdash; at least three days per week</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Hopping</li>
		<li>Skipping</li>
		<li>Jumping jacks</li>

		<li>Working with resistance bands</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="long adults">Adults (younger than 65&nbsp;years old and not recently pregnant)</h2>

<p><strong>Some physical activity is better than none!</strong> Inactive adults should slowly build up their physical activity. When doing aerobic activity, do at least 10&nbsp;minutes at a time to allow your heart to speed up for an extended chunk of time.</p>

<p>In general, 60&nbsp;minutes per week should be good enough for <em>some</em> health benefits, but this is minimal.</p>

<p>For major health benefits, do 150&nbsp;minutes (2&nbsp;hours, 30&nbsp;minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (30&nbsp;minutes on five days) per week or 75&nbsp;minutes (1&nbsp;hour, 15&nbsp;minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (25&nbsp;minutes on three days) per week.</p>

<p>For even more health benefits, do 300&nbsp;minutes (5&nbsp;hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 150&nbsp;minutes (2&nbsp;hours, 30&nbsp;minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity each week. <strong>The more active you are, the healthier you will be!</strong></p>

<p>Do muscle-strengthening activities (moderate or vigorous intensity) at least two days per week.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lifting weights</li>
	<li>Working with resistance bands</li>
	<li>Situps</li>
	<li>Pushups</li>
	<li>Yoga</li>
	<li>Heavy gardening</li>
</ul>

<p>For lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, due 40&nbsp;minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity three or four days per week.
