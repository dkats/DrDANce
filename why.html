<h1 id="short">Short version</h1>

<p>Obesity is a monumental health problem in the United States, and a large reason for that is diet and exercise. The main concern with obesity is that it puts people at risk for many, many diseases, leading to shorter life expectancy and worse quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>The health benefits of being fit and active are much greater than the risks of injury.</strong></p>

<p>By teaching kids (and adults) that exercise is important and can be fun, we're setting them up for a healthier future.</p>

<p>Physical activity helps to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers</li>
	<li>Control weight</li>
	<li>Reduce blood pressure</li>
	<li>Raise HDL ("good") cholesterol</li>
	<li>Strengthen bones and muscles</li>
	<li>Improve psychological well-being&mdash;including self-confidence, self-esteem, and mood</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="extra">Extra information</h1>

<p>Of the 1,571 kids measured in the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2,299 (65.3%) were underweight or normal by BMI, while 1,224 (34.7%) were overweight or obese. Of the 5,532 adults, 1,674 (30.3%) were underweight or normal, while 3,858 (69.7%) were overweight or obese.</p>

<p>Physical activity helps to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, stroke, colon cancer, and breast cancer (possibly also endometrial/uterine and lung cancer)</li>
	<li>Control weight: Physical activity raises your body's rate of metabolism, which leads to the burning of fat for energy and weight loss</li>
	<li>Reduce blood pressure</li>
	<li>Raise HDL ("good") cholesterol</li>
	<li>Strengthen bones and muscles (slowing the weakening and breaking of bones with age)</li>
	<li>Improve psychological well-being&mdash;including self-confidence, self-esteem, and mood (reduce risk of depression)</li>
	<li>Improve sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, out of U.S. high school students:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only 27% get 60 minutes of physical activity every day</li>
	<li>Only 52% do muscle strengthening activities</li>
	<li>Only 29% have daily physical education</li>
	<li>41% play video or computer games for 3 or more hours per day</li>
	<li>32% watch television 3 or more hours per day</li>
</ul>

<p>Those last two bullet points make it clear that almost every has the time for exercise. It's just a matter of finding the motivation and sticking to it.</p>
